        <p>
          The coronavirus continues to pose a serious public health risk.
          Viruses constantly change, and new versions emerge. The Delta variant
          is now the most common strain of the coronavirus in the United States.
        </p>

        <p>
          You should know that: The Delta variant is more contagious, causes
          more infections, and spreads faster than the original virus. The Delta
          variant may cause more severe illness than previous strains in
          unvaccinated people. Although vaccines provide strong protection
          against severe disease and death, fully vaccinated people can be
          infected by and transmit the Delta variant.
        </p>

        <p>
          That is why it is critical to get your vaccine and help your loved
          ones get the vaccine, too. Vaccines will protect you from severe
          illness and death from the coronavirus and the Delta variant. After
          you are fully vaccinated, wear a mask indoors in public places.

              Get a vaccine to protect yourself, your loved ones and your
              community. Vaccines are effective at preventing severe illness and
              death from the coronavirus and the Delta variant.
            </p>

            <p>
              Vaccines are safe and effective. Medical experts carefully tested
              the vaccines among thousands of adults with diverse backgrounds.

              After getting vaccinated, you might have some side effects, which
              are normal signs that your body is building protection. Common
              side effects are pain, redness, and swelling in the arm where you
              received the shot, as well as tiredness, headache, muscle pain,
              chills, fever, and nausea.
            </p>
            <p>
              These side effects could affect your ability to do daily
              activities, but they should go away in a few days.
            </p>
            <p>
              It typically takes two weeks after vaccination for the body to
              build protection (immunity) against the virus that causes
              COVID-19. You considered fully vaccinated two weeks after the 2nd
              dose of a two-dose vaccine or two weeks after a one-dose vaccine.

        <h1>What can I do after I am fully vaccinated?</h1>
        <div class="cocenter tab3">
          <div class="left">
            <p>
              After you are fully vaccinated, continue to wear a mask indoors in
              public places. The vaccine will protect you from severe illness
              and death, but you can still be infected and transmit the Delta
              variant to others.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have a weakened immune system, you may NOT be fully
              protected even after being fully vaccinated. Wear a mask in
              public, stay 6 feet apart from others, avoid crowds and poorly
              ventilated indoor spaces.
            </p>
            <p>
              You should still watch out for symptoms of COVID-19, especially if
              you've been around someone who is sick. If you have symptoms of
              COVID-19, get tested and stay home and away from others.
